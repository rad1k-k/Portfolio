        <h2>My career path</h2> <br>

        <p>After I completed a master's degree in Marketing, Finance and Management, I worked some time as a credit analyst and AR receivables specialist. By mid 2017 at the age of 28, I felt I needed a change, a break from open space office work.</p> <br>

        <p>I got a chance to travel around Europe as a flight attendant. I did also various certification courses in the field of Wellness. After that I applied this knowledge while working in Germany and Austria, where I am up to now. So far, I am still working as a Massage Therapist and at the same time preparing for a career switch into the IT field. </p> <br>

        <h2>Learning development a design</h2> <br>

        <p>When lockdown was announced back in 2020, I had no clue what was going to happen with my job.  Our industry has been widely affected and I was asking myself what the best next step is. As I browsed the internet I read an article which sectors are most stable and not threatened by this turbulent time - IT sector was a clear choice.</p> <br>

        <p>I was motivated to start something new. I did a little research on the knowledge I need to learn for the successful transit of my career. Out of curiosity I searched on Czechitas website, which is an organization focused on educating women in the IT field. Shortly after, I took a html, css course and I started coding as a way to gain some new skills during the long days of lockdown. First I had a lot of self-doubt and feared that I couldnt learn it with zero programming experience. But as time went by, the process of learning got easier.</p> <br>

        <p>After couple of months, when the lockdown ended, I returned to the work. Finding time to code was a big challenge, but I worked hard and I did not stop. Later on, I was also introduced to UX/UI Design and I joined the Scholarship Program for Google UX Design certification.</p> <br>

        <p>A few months later came another lockdown. Again, I had more time to dive into the IT topics and started learning from various mentors online.</p> <br>

        <p>Up to now I have been attending various workshops, coding bootcamp and online webinars on topics in the field of web development.  I like to also learn in online communities for web developers, github opensourse and youtube channels. Studying online allows me to work full-time and do the courses at the same time. Recently I started preparing this portfolio website, where I apply and practice the knowledge on a small projects. </p> <br>

        <h2>My new passion</h2> <br>

        <p>Since introduced to web development, I start my day with excitement for coding and creating new projects.  I have truly discovered my passion in life that gets even more exciting as the time goes by and I learn new things. </p> <br>

        <p>What makes development an interesting field for me? I like challenges. And becoming a web developer is not easy. Especially at the beginning I had many ups and downs. But the fact that there will always be additional challenges, more things to learn, and new technologies means that every single day, I can learn something new and that satisfies me. It is part of the reason, why development and design appeal to me. I love the idea of bringing thoughts to life. It is fun and interesting to create a design and then see how it comes to life with code.  I also enjoy when I solve some problem or find and fix an error in the code. </p> <br>

        
        <p>Coding has become a part of my daily routine and a passion of mine. I am continuing practising and would like to turn it into a full-time job and apply all the knowledge I have learned over the last two years.  Thanks to all great teachers and mentors for supporting me in developing new skills! </p> <br>

        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy being outdoors. You can usually find me in the mountains. I am an adventure seeker and forever learner.</p> <br>
